# Good mood

## Make us a happy worker, make trello a happy place to work.

### The importance of happiness

If a person is happy, then the happiness will be passed on to the people around him. A happy state is the best state of work. The products produced are also of the highest quality.

- If a person is happy, then he is also the most creative.
- If a person is happy, then he can also cooperate better with the people around him.
- If a person is happy, then he is also the most productive.
- If a person is happy, then he will not feel tired at work.

### We offer three features
- Self-talk to build confidence and improve self-recognition;
- A joke to make you feel better;
- A little game to relax.

### I am still developing the fourth feature
- Used to express gratitude to co-working partners.

If you have any suggestions or needs, please contact <wbohome@outlook.com>

Hello Epics at a glance

# Popular ways to use Hello Epics
- Share your best work by creating separate internal and client-facing boards, and moving cards across boards as needed. Hello Epics continues to track all related items, regardless of where the card lives.
- Track feature requests by creating cards for each request and grouping them by feature type.
- Increase project visibility by sharing parent cards with stakeholders and reserving child cards for your project team.

# Hello Epics enables you to...

## Build relationships

Nest child cards under their parent — or multiple parents — to create a hierarchy of cards. Link related cards across multiple boards to easily create dependencies, visualize related workstreams, and track overall progress.

## Get more done

Just as there are different ways to finish work, there are different ways to track completion. Choose from three different ways to mark a card as complete:

- Completing all items in a card’s checklist
- Marking it done via due date
- Moving a card to a designated ‘Done’ column

Complete cards and track progress

## See the big picture

Parent cards show how many children have been completed and how many are left. Click on parent cards to dive deeper: see an epic’s completion percentage and which list each child card is in. Navigate intuitively from parent to child and back again.

## Prioritize and update child cards

Drag and drop your child cards right on your parent to prioritize or change
their status.

Drag and drop child cards

## Grow your hierarchy

Hello Epics works intuitively. Create and attach child cards in three different ways:

Convert checklist items to child cards
Create new child cards directly on the parent
Attach existing cards as child cards
Create new child cards directly from the parent

## Work with other Power-Ups

We’re integrated with two popular Power-Ups so they work hand in hand with Hello Epics: Agile Tools by Corello and Card Numbers by Reenhanced. If you have these Power-Ups installed on your boards, then you’re good to go — there’s no setup needed.

## Protect your data

Hello Epics is committed to managing your data securely and transparently. We do not store any of your content — in fact, we never even see it. We will never share your personal information, and we are GDPR compliant.
